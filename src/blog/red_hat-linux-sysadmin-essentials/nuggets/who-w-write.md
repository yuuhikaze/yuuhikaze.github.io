-   Kick off a user from `ssh` and laugh at their impending disconnection: <https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/622>

    1.  See who's logged into your machine.

        ```bash
        $ who -u
        mmrozek     pts/0        2025-01-27 08:50   .          2081 (192.168.122.1)
        ```

    1.  Laugh at their impending disconnection (this step is optional, but encouraged).

        ```bash
        $ echo "HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA" | write mmrozek pts/0
        ```

    1.  Kill the corresponding process:

        ```bash
        $ kill -1 2081 # Send HUP signal to terminate connection gracefully. In case user is still connected, force the disconnection with `kill -9 2081`
        ```
